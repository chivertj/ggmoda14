gg-moda-14
=============

This code is related to object shape tracking using C++ and OpenCV. The code includes level set based active contour code, correspondence analysis and various probabilistic models. Much of the code was developed over the time period 2007-2014. The present form is the combination of two main projects being merged which however has not been finalised. There are therefore bugs and the systems have not been fully intergrated, so obviously this is a work in progress.
